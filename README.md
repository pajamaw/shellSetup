## Shell Setup
This contains everything to start a comp from scratch except for applications and setting up new keys. 

It has most of the nuts and bolts to utilize the `prezto` theme as well - although once cloned you'll need to update the .zprezto submodule folder. 
```console
cd $ZPREZTODIR
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
